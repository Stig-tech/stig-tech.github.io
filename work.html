									<h3>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama</h3>
									<strong>Application Development Intern</strong>
									<div class="meta">Birmingham, AL | May 2025 – July 2025</div>
									<p>Performed both manual and automated testing of internal and external web and desktop applications. Wrote detailed test cases and executed regression suites to validate bug fixes and new features. Collaborated with developers to triage defects, verify fixes, and improve release quality.</p>
									<p>Developed scripts and lightweight automation utilities to support future testing workflows, increase repeatability, and expand test coverage across critical user journeys. Leveraged version control to maintain test artifacts and documented test plans for the team.</p>
									<p>The biggest project I was brought on to was with all of the Application Development Interns including people from backgrounds such as engineering, data science, cybersecurity, and information technology. The project consisted of creating an internal tool from scratch, acting as a home page full of resources for everyone in the Application Development Department or those interested in learning more about it.</p>
